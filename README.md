# TranslationAssistant

# TODO
- Test if the single TemporaryTranslator is called optimally
- Should TranslationAssistant::onTextChanged be called?
- Write changes pending changes to .ts
    - Maybe have a save/save as/discard button
    - Also show pending changed(another proxy model)
- Optimize verify translations in one step
    - Include queue onTextChanged notifications and verity them all at interval
